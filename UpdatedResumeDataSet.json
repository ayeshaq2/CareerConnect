DDR process extracts all clinical, pre-clinical, study, product, subject, sites related information from the upstream applications like EPECS, CDSS, RCM, PRC, E-CLINICAL, EDH and after applying some business logic put it into DDR core tables. From these snapshot and dimensional layer are created which are used for reporting application.\n\nRole & Responsibilities:\nâ To understand & analyze the requirement documents and resolve the queries.\nâ To design Informatica mappings by using various basic transformations like Filter, Router, Source qualifier, Lookup etc and advance transformations like Aggregators, Joiner, Sorters and so on.\nâ Perform cross Unit and Integration testing for mappings developed within the team. Reporting bugs and bug fixing.\nâ Create workflow/batches and set the session dependencies.\nâ Implemented Change Data Capture using mapping parameters, SCD and SK generation.\nâ Developed Mapplet, reusable transformations to populate the data into data warehouse.\nâ Created Sessions & Worklets using workflow Manager to load the data into the Target Database.\nâ Involved in Unit Case Testing (UTC)\nâ Performing Unit Testing and UAT for SCD Type1/Type2, fact load and CDC implementation.\n\nPersonal Scan\n\nAddress: Jijayi Heights, Flat no 118, Narhe, (Police chowki) Pune- 411041"
